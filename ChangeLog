    Move .type_* entries above .cat_* entries.  Refs #12351
    
    This makes categories take precedence over types when deciding on
    colors, resulting in a more colorful (and easier to read) search
    results page.

    Reduce cache headers for program details ajax popup.
    
    As it stands, these are being set to 10 days beyond the program start
    time.  This means that mythweb will often show stale data for programs
    that have been updated since they were initially added to the guide.
    
    This reduces the cache time to 2 hours, which seems like a reasonable
    time to cache for, yet still get timely updates.
    
    Fixes #12415

    unbreak guide colors based on category_type
    
    It appears as if changes around other areas of the guide code uncovered
    this issue which has been around for a long time.
