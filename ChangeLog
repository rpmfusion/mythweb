    Fix MythWeb Upcoming Recordings programinfo usage.
    
    The programinfo refactor in #8406 changed the order of fields returned
    in a programinfo string list, and a reference was missed in the MythWeb
    Schedule class.  The result is that any recording rule with recordid of
    6 was skipped/didn't show in Upcoming Recordings.
    
    The original intent of the code was to skip recordings with recstatus of
    rsNotListed (as shown in commits e728aea5 and 508103511 , committed for
    which has since been modified, again, by a41e9657.  (Therefore, the
    index in this commit is correct for 0.25-fixes and above, but should be
    18 for 0.24-fixes.)
    
    Thanks to JK on the -users list for finding the issue.
