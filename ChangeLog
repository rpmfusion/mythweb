    Use Default recording rule template in MythWeb
    
    when creating new recording rules.  This patch only uses values from the
    Default recording rule template, but it's still better/more capable than
    the old approach that pulled values for a few parameters from settings.
    
    Patch by Paul Gardiner (thanks!) with minor changes by me.
    Fixes #11512.

    Backporting to 0.26 since users who upgraded from previous versions of
    MythTV (and, therefore, had set the no-longer-existing settings) were
    relying on their effect.  This provides a functional replacement that
    uses the proper approach for current MythTV.

    Remove use of deprecated default rec rule settings
    
    from MythWeb.  These values should all be set from the recording rule
    templates.  Fixes #11138.  Refs #11512.
    
    Backporting to 0.26 since there is no way to set the values being used
    by MythWeb in 0.26.
